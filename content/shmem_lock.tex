\begin{apiarguments}
\apiargument{IN}{lock}{A symmetric data object that is a scalar variable or an array
    of length \CONST{1}.  This data object must be set to \CONST{0} on all
    \acp{PE} prior to the first use.  \VAR{lock} must be of type \CONST{long}.
    When using \Fortran, it must be of default kind.}
\end{apiarguments}

\apidescription{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_set\_lock} routine sets a mutual exclusion lock after
    waiting for the lock to be freed by any other \ac{PE} currently holding
    the lock.  Waiting \acp{PE} are assured of getting the lock in a
    first-come, first-served manner.  The \FUNC{shmem\_test\_lock} routine sets
    a mutual exclusion lock only if it is currently cleared.  By using this
    routine, a \ac{PE} can avoid blocking on a set lock.  If the lock is
    currently set, the routine returns without waiting.  The
    \FUNC{shmem\_clear\_lock} routine releases a lock previously set by
    \FUNC{shmem\_set\_lock} or \FUNC{shmem\_test\_lock} after performing a
    quiet operation on the default context to ensure that all symmetric memory
    accesses that occurred during the critical region are complete.  These
    routines are appropriate for protecting a critical region from simultaneous
    update by multiple \acp{PE}.

    The \openshmem lock API provides a non-reentrant mutex.  Thus, a call to
    \FUNC{shmem\_set\_lock} or \FUNC{shmem\_test\_lock} when the calling PE
    already holds the given lock will result in undefined behavior.  In a
    multithreaded \openshmem program, the user must ensure that such calls do
    not occur.
}

\apireturnvalues{
    The \FUNC{shmem\_test\_lock} routine returns \CONST{0} if the lock was
    originally cleared and this call was able to set the lock. A value of
    \CONST{1} is returned if the lock had been set and the call returned without
    waiting to set the lock.
}

\apinotes{
    The term symmetric data object is defined in Section \ref{subsec:memory_model}.

    The lock variable must be initialized to zero before any PE performs an
    \openshmem lock operation on the given variable.  Accessing an in-use lock
    variable using any method other than the \openshmem lock API, e.g. using
    local load/store, RMA, or AMO operations, results in undefined behavior.

    Calls to \FUNC{shmem\_ctx\_quiet} can be performed prior to calling the
    \FUNC{shmem\_clear\_lock} routine to ensure completion of operations issued
    on additional contexts.
